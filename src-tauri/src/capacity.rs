//! Weekly-quota capacity ledger (#236): what 100% of a provider's weekly
//! window is worth in tokens and API-equivalent dollars.
//!
//! While a weekly window runs, the cycle's tokens/cost come from the
//! spend scan's hourly buckets (spend::window_totals) — a live estimate
//! of what 100% would cost. When Pane observes a window at 100% the
//! cycle is frozen once a scan STARTED at-or-after that moment lands
//! (the scan runs concurrently, so files read before the hit can't
//! prove the final usage); those totals become an "observed" sample,
//! never repriced.
//! A window that resets before 100% is
//! recorded "incomplete" — partial coverage (usage on other devices or a
//! shared account) can only under-count, so it never counts as a sample.
//!
//! State lives in %APPDATA%\Pane\quota_cycles.json, written atomically
//! with the same owner-only helper the credential stores use.
